It looks like you've started drafting a postmortem for a PostgreSQL setup issue, but it seems there are some sections that need editing to reflect the PostgreSQL context instead of Apache. Hereâ€™s a revised version tailored to your scenario:

# **Postmortem: PostgreSQL Setup Issue on Docker**

### **Incident Date:** 23rd of July, 2024  
### **Authors:** Iwegbu Jedidiah

## **Summary**

On 23rd of July, 2024, while setting up a PostgreSQL database and Adminer in Docker containers for a backend tutorial, a critical issue occurred. This resulted in the web application being unable to perform CRUD operations and becoming unreachable for several hours. This document outlines the incident, resolution steps, root cause analysis, and lessons learned.

## **Timeline**

- **09:02 - 09:17: Pulling of Images from Docker Hub:**
  - Pulled the required PostgreSQL and Adminer images from Docker Hub.

- **09:27 - 09:50: Initial Configuration:**
  - Configured the Docker containers via a `docker-compose.yml` file. Set networks and ports during this step.

- **09:50 - 10:16: Testing:**
  - Attempted to connect to the PostgreSQL database using `psql`. An error indicated that no service was running on the specified port.

- **10:16 - 11:50: Server Unreachable:**
  - The web application became unreachable, with no response to HTTP requests. Remote troubleshooting was not possible due to the server being unresponsive.

- **11:50 - 13:00: Physical Access and Diagnosis:**
  - Gained physical access to the server and identified that the PostgreSQL container had been configured with an incorrect port, causing the `psql` daemon to fail and block all inbound connections.

- **13:00 - 13:30: Issue Resolution:**
  - Corrected the misconfigured port in the `docker-compose.yml` file, restarted the PostgreSQL container, and restored functionality to the web application.

- **13:30: Server Back Online:**
  - The server and web application became fully operational again, with the PostgreSQL service running as expected.

## **Root Cause**

The issue was caused by a misconfiguration in the `docker-compose.yml` file, where an incorrect port was assigned to the PostgreSQL container. This caused the PostgreSQL service to fail and, coupled with a network misconfiguration, rendered the server inaccessible.

## **Impact**

- **Server Downtime:** Approximately 4 hours.
- **Service Interruption:** The web application was unable to perform CRUD operations and was inaccessible during this period.
- **User Impact:** Users experienced service outages, potentially leading to frustration and loss of data or progress in the tutorial.

## **Resolution**

- **Configuration Correction:** The `docker-compose.yml` file was corrected to assign the appropriate port to the PostgreSQL container.
- **Service Restart:** The PostgreSQL container was restarted, restoring full functionality to the web application.

## **Lessons Learned**

1. **Thorough Configuration Review:**
   - Ensure Docker configuration files are thoroughly reviewed before deployment, especially for critical services like databases.

2. **Staging Environment Testing:**
   - Test Docker configurations in a staging environment to catch potential issues before deploying to production.

3. **Improved Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Implement monitoring and alerting for Docker containers to quickly detect and respond to service failures.

4. **Detailed Documentation:**
   - Maintain detailed documentation of Docker setup and configuration steps to ensure consistency and avoid misconfigurations.

## **Action Items**

- **Implement Pre-deployment Testing:** Ensure all configurations are tested in a staging environment before production deployment.
- **Update Docker Documentation:** Document all Docker setup steps, including port configurations and network settings.
- **Enhance Monitoring:** Set up monitoring and alerting for Docker containers to detect issues early.

## **Conclusion**

This incident highlighted the importance of careful configuration management and testing before deploying changes to a production environment. By addressing the lessons learned and implementing the action items, we aim to prevent similar issues in the future and improve our overall Docker management processes.
