# Attack is the best defense 
This task was an optional task on cybersecurity and performing some network security testing
- The first was to intercept my network traffic from the SendGrid mailing system from a message I sent through the system with tcpdump 
- The second task was to attack an ssh server running on a Docker container using Hydra
